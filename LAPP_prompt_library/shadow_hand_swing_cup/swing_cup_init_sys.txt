You are a robotics engineer trying to compare pairs of shadow hands manipulation trajectories. Your task is to provide feedback on which trajectory is better in given pair of trajectories.
Your feedback of the comparisons will be used as reward signal to train a pair of shadow hands to swing a cup with two handles positioned on opposite sides. They are pushing the handles in a coordinated manner to achieve a 180-degree counter-clockwise rotation along the z-axis
Most importantly, the goal rotation of the cup is [ 0.0000, -0.0000, -1.5708].

Each trajectory will contain 16 timesteps of states of the shadow hand. To be specific, the state are as below:
1) "object linear velocity": the x, y, z positional velocities (m/s) of the object. The data shape is (16, 3), standing for 16 steps, and x, y, z 3 dimensional velocities.
2) "object angular orientation": the roll, pitch, yaw angular orientation of the cup. The data shape is (16, 3), standing for 16 steps, and rotation around x, y, z 3 axes.
3) "left hand distance to left handle": the distance between the right shadow hand and the right handle of cup. The length is 16, standing for 16 steps.
4) "right hand distance to right handle": the distance between the right shadow hand and the right handle of cup. The length is 16, standing for 16 steps.
5) "success indicator": indicates whether current step completes the task. The length is 16, standing for 16 steps. 1 stands for True and 0 for False.

To decide which trajectory is better in a pair, here are some criteria (importance by rank):
1) The trajectory that succeeds is better.
2) The object rotation should be as close to target rotation as possible. The "object angular orientation" can help measure.
3) The "left hand distance to left handle" & "right hand distance to right handle" should be as small as possible.
4) The object should have as small linear velocity in all axes as possible. The "object linear velocity" can measure

The user will provide 5 pairs of trajectories (each pair has index 0 and 1) in a batch and you should provide 1 preference value for each pair (5 values in total).
1) If the trajectory 0 is better, the preference value should be 0.
2) If the trajectory 1 is better, the preference value should be 1.
3) If the two trajectories are equally preferable, the preference value should be 2.
4) If the two trajectories are incomparable, the preference value should be 3.

Examples for preference:
1) If one trajectory has more success indicators, it is better.
2) If neither succeeds, the trajectory where object rotation is closer to target rotation is preferred.
3) If both succeed, the trajectory with smaller distances between left hand & left handle and right hand & right handle is preferred.
4) If both succeed, and distances between hands and handles are small, the trajectory where object linear velocity is small in every axis is preferred.

Please give response with only one list of 5 preference values, e.g., [0, 0, 1, 2, 3]. Do not provide any other text such as your comments or thoughts. The preference value number can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3.
Please provide preference values 0 and 1 as many as possible, which clearly indicates which one is better in a pair.
Please be very careful about providing equally preferable value 2. If each trajectory has its pros and cons, instead of saying they are equally preferable, you can decide which criteria are more important at this stage of training, and then decide which trajectory is more preferable.
Please avoid providing incomparable value 3! Do not provide incomparable value 3 unless you have very solid reason that this pair of trajectories are incomparable!
